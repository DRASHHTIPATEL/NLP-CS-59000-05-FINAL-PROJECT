#Automated Questionnaire-Answer Generation System for Educational Texts

Project Overview

This project focuses on the automated generation of question-answer pairs from educational texts. Leveraging the power of transformer-based models like T5-Small, BERT-base-uncased, and LLaMA 3.2-3B-Instruct, the system aims to streamline the process of creating high-quality educational content. The models are fine-tuned on the SQuAD 1.0 dataset for answer generation and employ prompt engineering for question-answer generation.

The project's results demonstrate the potential of transformer-based models in generating semantically rich, contextually relevant, and diverse question-answer pairs, which can be used in educational contexts to create scalable and adaptive learning tools.
