# NLP-CS-59000-05-FINAL-PROJECT<br>
"Questionnaire Generator using Educational Texts"<br>
Aim:The project will develop an AI system that would automatically generate questions and answers for educational purposes and subsequently check their quality and relevance. This is based on pre-trained NLP models, such as the T5, fine-tuned on datasets like SQuAD in order to ensure accuracy and in-context question-answer generation.
